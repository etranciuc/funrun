Anyway, thanks to the city's obsession with parking tickets, I can track down the car's location whenever it gets scanned by a meter maid.\n\n I think if you search the car you might find some useful information. \n\nOnce I give you the car's current location, you aren't going to have much time to get there before the driver gets back, so be sure to hurry."
