Test Runs

10/3/10 - Had a path routed out to run. When I first left the house it took awhile to discover my location, but once I got to the end of the driveway, it worked. I quickly discovered that the points I had placed were too close together to be useful with a 60 second time limit. It worked well for awhile, but then I started to get ahead of the points. Pretty much the entire run from the end of Hunter Pt to the bike path was not working, but eventually the points caught up to me and I had a good run on the bike path. One of the points was too far for me to reach in 60 seconds, and then I pretty much couldnt reach the next points for awhile until I caught up. There was no good notification that the run was over. Sometimes I would run past a point and it wouldnt count it as a success.
